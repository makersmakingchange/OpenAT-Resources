# Open AT Resources
This is a GitHub repository used to host resources that will support designers to create open source assistive devices (Open AT devices). Some of the resources were created by Makers Making Change (MMC), while others were created by different groups. These resources are intended to help new designers getting started, but may also be helpful for more experienced designers as well. There is a website created for ease of viewing/downloading the files at INSERT THE LINK HERE.

The Neil Squire Society and the Makers Making Change program cannot guarantee that external links will remain active, and has no involvement in moderating external communities. You can see examples of other Open AT Devices at the Makers Making Change [website](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/category/assistive-devices). 

## Overview

This repository was created as a place to store resources which can help new designers create Open AT devices. Some of the information contained within is specific to creating devices to be submitted to Makers Making Change, but most of the information would be helpful to designers creating their own devices unrelated to MMC.

If you have any suggestions on improving any of these resources, or would like to add to the resources, please create an Issue on this repository, or [contact us](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/contact).
