# Open AT Resources
This is a GitHub repository used to host resources that will support designers to create open source assistive devices (Open AT devices). Some of the resources were created by Makers Making Change (MMC), while others were created by different groups. These resources are intended to help new designers getting started, but may also be helpful for more experienced designers as well. There is a website created for ease of viewing/downloading the files at [Open AT Resources](https://makersmakingchange.github.io/OpenAT-Resources/).

The Neil Squire Society and the Makers Making Change program cannot guarantee that external links will remain active, and has no involvement in moderating external communities. You can see examples of other Open AT Devices at the Makers Making Change [website](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/category/assistive-devices). 

## Overview

This repository was created as a place to store resources which can help new designers create Open AT devices. Some of the information contained within is specific to creating devices to be submitted to Makers Making Change, but most of the information would be helpful to designers creating their own devices unrelated to MMC.

If you have any suggestions on improving any of these resources, or would like to add to the resources, please create an Issue on this repository, or [contact us](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/contact).

## GitHub

MMC has started hosting all our designs on GitHub, so we created this resource to help volunteers navigate GitHub to download and use our designs, and to create their own designs. The GitHub resource is useful for any user who would like to learn how to use GitHub.

## 3D Printing

Most devices from MMC require 3D printing so this resource is designed to help people learn the basics of 3D printing. The 3D printing resource is useful for any user who would like to learn 3D printing.

## CAD Design

Most designs hosted with MMC will require CAD modelling so this resource is designed to help people learn the basics of using CAD software. The CAD design resource is useful for any user who would like to learn CAD modelling.

## Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design

Creating custom PCBs can be useful for designs with complex electronics so this resource helps designers learn how to design their own custom PCBs. The PCB design resource is useful for any user who would like to learn how to design PCBs.

## Arduino

MMC uses Arduino for any devices tha require firmware, so this resource was designed to help volunteers learn how to use Arduino, both for flashing existing firmware to devices and writing their own code. The Arduino resource is useful for any user who would like to learn how to use Arduino.

## Open Source Licenses

Devices hosted by MMC must have at least one open source license for them, so this resource helps designers learn about different open source licenses for documentation, hardware, and software/firmware. The open source licenses resource is more useful for people intending to submit designs to MMC as we require devices to be open source.

## Taking and Using Photos

Device documentation and posting requires different types of images/photos of the device so this photo resource was created to help designers take useful images and use them appropriately in documentation. The photo resource is useful for any designer, but is particularly useful for anyone planning to submit a design to MMC.

## Creating Videos

This resource is still under development and we are looking for volunteers with video experience who would be interested in developing it.

Assembly and use videos for devices can be extremely helpful for other makers and users of devices, so this resource will describe best practices for taking, editing, and using videos. The video resource will be useful for any designer.

## Common Part Bill of Materials (BOM)

There are many parts that are used across multiple MMC devices, so this resource contains all the information requried to fill in the BOM lines for a device that uses any of these common parts. Designers can copy and paste the lines from this BOM into the BOM for their device. The BOM resource is most useful for designers who are using the [MMC documentation templates](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Template).

## Commmon Part Images

The common part images resource has photos of commonly used parts across multiple MMC devices. Like the BOM resource, designers can use these images to show each component in their device in the Maker Guide. The common part images resource is most useful for designers who are using the [MMC documentation templates](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Template).
