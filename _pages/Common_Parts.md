title: "Commonly Used Parts"
layout: splash
excerpt: |
  We created a spreadsheet that lists commonly used parts in our devices, along with the price, and links to buy them.

  - This spreadsheet is meant for designers to use to copy and paste into their own BOMs if using parts listed on the spreadsheet.
  - When designing new devices, it may also be useful to consult this list to choose parts like fasteners, jacks, and microcontrollers.

  See more information on the spreadsheet below.

  We are also compiling images for all the commonly used parts in this spreadsheet for designers to use in Maker Guides for new devices.

    title: "What is Included"
    excerpt: |
      This spreadsheet contains all the information required in a Bill of Materials for the most commonly used parts across devices in our library. The spreadsheet follows the same layout as our BOM template, so a designer can copy and paste from this BOM into the BOM for a new device.
