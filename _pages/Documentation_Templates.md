title: "Documentation Templates"
layout: splash
excerpt: |
  We created our own documentation templates to follow when creating new devices, or adding new devices to our library. We wanted to make these templates available for others to use when documenting their own designs. These templates have their own repository on GitHub to make it easy to create a cloned version to start documenting your own design.
